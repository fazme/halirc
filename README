Installation
============

those packages must be installed:

python-daemon
python-lock
python-twisted-conch

if you want halirc to react on remote
controls (you probably will), lirc needs
to be installed and configured for the wanted
remotes.

if you want to control the Gembird USB controlled
power outlet, please install sispmctl.

if you want to control vdr, vdr needs to
be installed.

if you can show messages via an Xserver, you
can install xosd and show OSD messages.
For me, the nvidia vdpau driver segfaults
if doing this while HD material is shown
with vdr and libxineoutput. This is with
master branch from git://projects.vdr-developer.org/xine-lib.git
With the df-osd-handling+alter-vdpau-h264-decoder
branch, this works fine.


Usage
=====

Everything in halirc.py is just an example. You want to start
your own myhalirc.py and do there whatever you want.
If you want to add support for new sources of events
or for new devices to be controlled, you most certainly
want to take a crash course in python-twisted first.
Learn about the class Deferred. Never use time.sleep() in
your code, everything is event driven.
