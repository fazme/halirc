Installation
============

those packages must be installed:

python-daemon
python-lock
python-twisted-conch

if you use vdr on an Xserver, you
can install xosd and show OSD messages

Usage
=====

Everything in halirc.py is just an example. You want to start
your own myhalirc.py and do there whatever you want.
If you want to add support for new sources of events
or for new devices to be controlled, you most certainly
want to take a crash course in python-twisted first.
Learn about the class Deferred. Never use time.sleep() in
your code, everything is event driven.
